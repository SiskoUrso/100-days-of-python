# Day 18 - Working more with Turtle

The goal of this project was to recreate a hirst spot painting.First the step was to use colorgram to extract colors from an image. The image in question was a hirst spot painting that you choose from a google search.
That step can be seen in extracting_colors_with_colorgram.py. 

The rules were: 

- To create spot painting 10 x 10 rows of dots. 
- Each dot should be around 20 in size
- Each dot should be spaced by 50 paces
- Painting 100 dots in total.
- Using a random color for each dot from a list of colors pulled from the image in question.
