# Blackjack Game - First Capstone Project

This was the first capstone project provided in the 100 days of python. The list of cards were provided to start with and the following rules were given:

- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
- Use the following list as the deck of cards: cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
- The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
- The computer is the dealer.

There was also a difficulty selection option to choose from :

- Normal ðŸ˜Ž: Use all Hints below to complete the project.
- Hard ðŸ¤”: Use only Hints 1, 2, 3 to complete the project.
- Extra Hard ðŸ˜­: Only use Hints 1 & 2 to complete the project.
- Expert ðŸ¤¯: Only use Hint 1 to complete the project.

For myself I only used 1 hint but in fairness this was due to in the video of Angela explaining the rules of the projects and showing what the first 3 hints would lead you to I determined from that that the 3rd hint option would provide a flowchart which is the only hint I used during this project.
