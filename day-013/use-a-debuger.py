'''Debuggers allows us to peek into our code during execution and pause on chosen lines to figure out what is the inner mechanism and where it's going wrong.

There are a couple of things that are the same in most IDEs which you should be familiar with:

Breakpoint - You can set a breakpoint by clicking on a line in the gutter of the code (where the line numbers are). This line will be where the program pauses during debug run.

Step Over - This button will go through the execution of your code line by line and allow you to view the intermediate values of your variables.

Step Into - This will enter into any other modules that your code references. e.g. If you use a function from the random module it will show you the original code for that function so you can better understand its functionality and how it relates to your problems.

Step Into My Code - This does the same thing as Step Into, but it limits the scope to your own project code and ignores library code such as random.

Use the PyCharm debugger to figure out what is the issue in the starting code and fix it.'''

# example code

# import random
# import maths


# def mutate(a_list):
#     b_list = []
#     new_item = 0
#     for item in a_list:
#         new_item = item * 2
#         new_item += random.randint(1, 3)
#         new_item = maths.add(new_item, item)
#     b_list.append(new_item)
#     print(b_list)


# mutate([1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13])


# fixed code using the debugger to determine that the b_list was not being appended correctly and was adding the last number in the for loop and not each number in the list.
