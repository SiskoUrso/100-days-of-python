# Day 17 Project - Quiz Game using classes.

The project for Day 17 was more of a pause challenge throughout the video of learning how to create and work with classes. 

Multiple inputs were provided for the project during this time and was more guided than provided with steps and run free. 

Originally a data list of questions and answers were provided but the last part of the project was changing the data to data from [The Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) using the json the api outputs.

As final fix that I incorporated was that quotes in the json were showing as the html equivalent of quote, set the replace function to replace with an actual quote to avoid the questions having unnecessary quote html code.
